This repository is a reference implementation of the
BLESSED SOURCE PROTOCOL and the BLESSED REPO PROTOCOL
described in companion documents.

In short, executing the script [./install] will result
in the following proxy assignments:

    [~/.local/bin/blessed.manOfEden] -> [./suite.adam/adam]
    [~/.local/bin/blessed.womanOfEden] -> [./suite.eve/eve]

That is to say, an executable script named [blessed.manOfEden]
will be placed in the local bin, after which the invokation of
[blessed.manbOfEden] will result in a managed invokation of the
script [./suite.adam/adam] (and likewise with with [eve]).
